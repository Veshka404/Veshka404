Hey there and Welcome! 

I’m Veshka, and I couldn’t be more excited to kick off this blog series, where I’ll share my journey as I set out to become a Freelance Cloud Security (AI/ML) Solution Architect. 

First, let me get a proper introducing and explain my Nub-to-Solution Architect starting journey. 

I come from a unique background – before diving into tech, I spent several years as a lawyer, even lecturing on law at the college level. Later, I transitioned into procurement law, where I led a team in contract management. These roles gave me a deep understanding of regulations, compliance, and strategy, all of which I now see as powerful assets in the tech world, especially as I shift focus toward cloud security.

So, Why Cloud Security (AI/ML) Solution Architecture?

For me, this journey into Cloud AI/ML and security combines the thrill of navigating complex systems with the potential to contribute to large-scale, impactful solutions. Specializing in cloud security feels like a natural extension of my background for my Lawyer DNA is problem-solving, and I’m excited to bring both my legal and leadership experience into this next chapter.

I’ve always loved the thrill of solving complex problems with innovative tech, so this industry like the perfect mix of creativity and real-world impact. As a Cloud Security (AI/ML) Solution Architect, I’ll be working at the heart of this transformation, building smart, scalable systems that can redefine how businesses operate. The chance to work on varied projects, stay on the cutting edge, and make a real impact keeps me motivated.

Some milestones I’ve outlined  for this journey:

- Python and AI Foundations: Getting a solid start with Python fundations, core AI concepts ;
- Cloud Fundamentals: Focusing on AWS to understand cloud essentials ;
- Advanced Python and AI: Leveling up with TensorFlow and real-world applications ;
- Cloud Architecture: Learning to create scalable cloud solutions ;
- Security Fundamentals: Ensuring that security is baked into every project ;
- AI/ML Engineering: Specializing in machine learning for cloud environments ;
- Advanced Cloud Security: Getting into the details of secure cloud systems ;
- Business Skills: Building project management and client interaction skills.

I’ll be tackling hands-on projects throughout to put these skills into practice and build a strong portfolio. By the way, I expect GitHub to be a good mentorship finder to achieve my goals ! 
  
I’ve already completed the following ones : 

- Python 4 Everybody (Coursera) ;
- Python Essentials 1 & 2 (Cisco Academy);
- IBM Python for Data Science, AI & Development (Coursera)
- (...)
  
Here, I’ll be sharing :
Learning updates and milestones ;
Insights from the courses and certifications I’m taking ;
Project breakdowns with tips and takeaways ;
Challenges I face (and hopefully conquer!)
Resources and recommendations that help me along the way

If you’re on a similar path, interested in cloud architecture, or just love tech, I’d love for you to join me on this ambitious journey. 

Let’s connect, share ideas, and keep each other motivated!

Looking forward to the adventure ahead!
