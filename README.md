"My Journey Begins: From Tech Enthusiast to Freelance Cloud Security (AI/ML) Solution Architect"

Hey there!

Welcome! I’m Veshka, and I couldn’t be more excited to kick off this blog series, where I’ll share my journey as I set out to become a Freelance Cloud Security (AI/ML) Solution Architect. My goal? To capture the ups and downs, the challenges, and the wins as I dive into the world of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
So, Why Cloud Security (AI/ML) Solution Architecture?

The tech world is racing forward, and the fusion of cloud computing with AI and ML is transforming industries in ways we’ve never seen. I’ve always loved the thrill of solving complex problems with innovative tech, so this field feels like the perfect mix of creativity and real-world impact.
As a Cloud Security (AI/ML) Solution Architect, I’ll be working at the heart of this transformation, building smart, scalable systems that can redefine how businesses operate. The chance to work on varied projects, stay on the cutting edge, and make a real impact keeps me motivated.
My Background and What Drives Me.

I come from a unique background – before diving into tech, I spent several years as a lawyer, even lecturing on law at the college level. Later, I transitioned into procurement law, where I led a team in contract management. These roles gave me a deep understanding of regulations, compliance, and strategy, all of which I now see as powerful assets in the tech world, especially as I shift focus toward cloud security.
For me, this journey into Cloud AI/ML and security combines the thrill of navigating complex systems with the potential to contribute to large-scale, impactful solutions. Specializing in cloud security feels like a natural extension of my background for my Lawyer DNA is problem-solving, and I’m excited to bring both my legal and leadership experience into this next chapter.

The Roadmap Ahead

To stay on track, I’ve outlined some milestones for this journey:
- Python and AI Foundations: Getting a solid start with Python fundations, core AI concepts ;
- Cloud Fundamentals: Focusing on AWS to understand cloud essentials ;
- Advanced Python and AI: Leveling up with TensorFlow and real-world applications ;
- Cloud Architecture: Learning to create scalable cloud solutions ;
- Security Fundamentals: Ensuring that security is baked into every project ;
- AI/ML Engineering: Specializing in machine learning for cloud environments ;
- Advanced Cloud Security: Getting into the details of secure cloud systems ;
- Business Skills: Building project management and client interaction skills.

I’ll be tackling hands-on projects throughout to put these skills into practice and build a strong portfolio. By the way, I expect GitHub to be a good mentorship finder to achieve my goals ! 

My First Steps

Starting with Python and AI basics, my first big goals are:
- Completing a comprehensive Python course ;
- Building a data analysis project in Python ;
- Beginning my AWS journey through their free tier
  
I’m thrilled to share that I’ve already completed the following ones : 

- Python 4 Everybody (Coursera) ;
- Python Essentials 1 & 2 (Cisco Academy);
- IBM Python for Data Science, AI & Development (Coursera)

What You’ll Find Here

In this blog, I’ll be sharing:
Learning updates and milestones ;
Insights from the courses and certifications I’m taking ;
Project breakdowns with tips and takeaways ;
Challenges I face (and hopefully conquer!)
Resources and recommendations that help me along the way

Let’s Learn Together!

If you’re on a similar path, interested in cloud architecture, or just love tech, I’d love for you to join me on this ambitious journey. Let’s connect, share ideas, and keep each other motivated!
Looking forward to the adventure ahead!
